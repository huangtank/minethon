"""Bot — public entry point for minethon.

Runtime behavior lives here. A sibling `bot.pyi` (generated from
mineflayer's `index.d.ts`) supplies the typed overloads that IDEs
use for completion of property and method signatures.

Pure synchronous callback model — no asyncio. Event handlers are
registered exclusively via subclassing :class:`EventAdaptor` and
calling :meth:`Bot.bind`. The legacy decorator entries
(`bot.on(...)`, `bot.once(...)`, `@bot.on_<event>`) have been
removed in favor of the single class-based path.

    Mineflayer's TypeScript typings sometimes declare trailing callback
    parameters that the JS runtime never actually emits (the ``chat`` event's
    ``matches: string[] | null`` is the canonical example — the type
    advertises 5 args but ``lib/plugins/chat.js`` only emits 4). A handler
    written against the declared signature would otherwise crash with
    ``TypeError: missing positional argument``.

    This wrapper:

    * drops the leading emitter arg when JSPyBridge injects it. The pinned
      runtime (Node 22+, javascript 1.2.x) never injects — `needsNodePatches`
      only returns true on Node 14/15 — so detection is deliberately narrow:
      a known ``_REAL_ARGC`` entry whose observed count matches exactly
      (``len(args) == real_argc + 1``), or proxy identity
      (``args[0] is emitter``). Arity excess is **not** treated as injection:
      a short handler (``def on_chat(self, username, message)``) legitimately
      receives more real args than it declares, and stripping the first one
      would hand it the wrong values — excess args are truncated from the
      end instead.
    * pads missing trailing positional args with ``None``
    * truncates any excess positional args JS emits (from the end)
    * isolates handler exceptions: a bug in a student handler prints a
      friendly message plus the traceback and skips that one event, instead
      of flowing back into JS as an unhandled rejection that kills the node
      process (Node ≥15 terminates on unhandled rejections) and leaves the

    Two ways to call it:

      `mineflayer.createBot()` with snake_case (`auth_server` → `authServer`).
    - `create_bot("g-swim")` / `create_bot("swim")` — Hack-The-SDGs shorthand:
      host + credentials are resolved from this PC's identity file, and the call
      blocks until the bot has spawned so a straight-line student script can act
      immediately. Explicit keyword options still override resolved ones.

    Every action command pauses `instruction_sleep` seconds afterwards so each
    step of a straight-line script is visible. Pass `bypass_instruction_sleep=True`
    to turn that off, or `instruction_sleep=0.1` to shorten it.
